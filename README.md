<b>Pattern Recognition (PR), 2025</b>

</div>

* We introduce MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset that contains the largest 97,455 Chinese character categories.
* MegaHan97K includes Chinese characters of 97,455 categories, which significantly surpasses existing datasets with at least six times larger categories and holds the largest volume.
* MegaHan97K pioneers to support the latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard, ensuring the most comprehensive coverage and compatibility with modern Chinese processing systems.
* MegaHan97K contains three distinct subsets: handwritten, historical, and synthetic. Each subset contains a greater number of character categories compared to existing datasets, resulting in remarkable scale and diversity advantages.
* MegaHan97K effectively mitigates long-tail distribution issues by providing a balanced and sufficient number of samples for each category, ensuring robust training and validation of CCR models.
